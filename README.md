# RAverSIde: AI-Powered Reverse Engineering Assistant

## Introduction

Welcome to the RAverSIde GitHub repository! RAverSIde is an AI-powered assistant designed to revolutionize the reverse engineering process by integrating seamlessly with the well-known Ghidra application. By leveraging artificial intelligence, RAverSIde transforms the traditionally complex process of reverse engineering into a smooth, efficient, and more precise experience.

## Project Structure

This repository contains three main components:

1. **Plugin**: The RAverSIde plugin for Ghidra.
2. **Server**: The backend server that supports the plugin.
3. **AI Test Site**: A web interface for testing AI functionalities.

## Features

RAverSIde offers a suite of features, all utilizing AI to enhance the reverse engineering process:

1. **Analysis and Highlighting of Critical Lines**: Automatically detects and highlights critical lines in the assembler, adding relevant comments to aid in understanding key points and potential vulnerabilities.
2. **Chatbot Assistance**: Integrated chatbot that allows users to ask specific questions about parts of the code, providing interactive and personalized support.
3. **Renaming Option**: Offers a renaming feature to help users better understand decompiled code by changing variable and function names to more comprehensible terms, facilitating easier analysis and comprehension.

## Installation and Usage

### Plugin Installation

To install the RAverSIde Plugin, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Plugin**: Obtain the ZIP file containing the RAverSIde plugin.
2. **Open Ghidra**: Launch Ghidra.
3. **Install the Extension**:
    - Navigate to `File` > `Install Extensions`.
    - Click the `+` button and select the downloaded ZIP file.
4. **Restart Ghidra**: Restart Ghidra to apply the changes.
5. **Read the Plugin ReadMe**: For detailed instructions and configurations, refer to the special README located in the plugin directory.

### Server Setup

The Raverside Server is hosted at [raverside-server.aymeric-daniel.com](http://raverside-server.aymeric-daniel.com/). For other ways to use the server, including Docker and local setup, please refer to the special README located in the server directory.

### Connecting Plugin to Server

Ensure your RAverSIde Plugin is configured to communicate with the correct server endpoint:

- **Hosted Server**: `http://raverside-server.aymeric-daniel.com`
- **Docker/Local Server**: `http://localhost:5001`

## AI Test Site

The AI test site provides a web interface for testing various AI functionalities integrated into RAverSIde. It allows users to experiment with different prompts and see the AI's responses in real-time, facilitating better understanding and fine-tuning of the system.

## How RAverSIde Works

RAverSIde is composed of a Java-based plugin for Ghidra, which communicates with a Python-based API server. The server processes the decompiled code and interacts with the AI using specific prompts to return information in JSON format. This approach enhances precision and saves time for reverse engineers by providing insightful, AI-generated assistance directly within Ghidra.
